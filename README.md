### 1. Introduction
In todayâ€™s world, huge quantity of food is being 
wasted on a constant basis in our homes,Hotels 
weddings and parties and many other places. Many 
individuals give food, garments and books and so 
forth physically by visiting better places all alone to 
address this emergency of yearning just as food 
wastage in our country. 
ALMS basically helps us by 
creating a platform for the donators to donate 
anything they want to. ALMS app has two kind of 
logins where the user needs to login as either 
volunteer or a donator. The new users will have to 
register themselves by giving basic information. 
Food is dropped in a e-bin where the quality is 
thoroughly verified. On successful donation a bill is 
generated. Account of donations in a day is made 
public such that all the app users can view how 
many needful are being benefited from their 
donations. 
The donators can even become volunteers 
and help in a good deed if they wish to by registering 
as Volunteers. All the achievements and pictures by 
the ALMS organization will be available in the 
about section of the app or the website. This 
platform will be of extraordinary benefit to keep 
away from any sort of food wastage and individuals 
can likewise go along with us as volunteers who can 
give food in their neighborhood. We will set up an 
association with NGO's who will assist us with giving 
the food, garments and books to one side individuals.

### 2. Hardware components and working
ELEMENTS USED IN THE CIRCUIT 
PREPARATION.
i)LM358 op-Amp :- Wide supply ranges, 
low supply current drain, supply voltage 
independence, and a large unity gain 
bandwidth are among these qualities.

ii)5V relay:- We utilised a +5V DC supply 
to one end of the coil and a switch to ground 
the other end because the relay has a 5V 
trigger voltage.33 k ohm , 68 k ohm, 100 k 
ohm, 560 ohm, 220 ohm

iii)2n22 transistor:- A transistor is a 
semiconductor device that can conduct as 
well as insulate electrical current or voltage. 
A transistor is a switch and an amplifier in
one.

iv)10K potentiometer:- When a 
potentiometer is connected in a circuit and 
the null point is reached, it draws no current. 
As a result, it determines the cell's e.m.f. A 
potentiometer can be used to accurately 
measure extremely small p.d. that a 
voltmeter cannot measure. Using a very 
long wire and a very slight potential 
gradient, this can be accomplished.

v) 1n4007 diode:- Diodes aid in the 
execution of digital logic. They're used to 
isolate signals from a power source.

vi)100 pf capacitor:- In a DC circuit, the 
capacitor operates as an open switch once it 
has been charged with the applied voltage.

viii)555 IC Transmitter and receiver:- for 
transmitting and receiving the signals

ix)(IR sensor):- for sensing the objects coming near the 
bin to donate or disperse.

x)Servo motor 5V:- A rotary actuator or linear actuator 
is a servo motor. It enables accurate angular or linear 
position, velocity, and acceleration control. It is made of 
an appropriate motor and a position feedback sensor.

xi)9v or 5v power supply:- for the working of the
circuit.

 ### 3. Software requirements
> Platforms:Flutter,Android studio.
Language:html,java,php,mysql.
Database:Mysql

### 4. How to implement the code
Website
1. Download and install xampp into your desktop 
2.run the apache and MySQL methods in xampp
3. Open the login.html using browser and its done as all the navigations has been connected to the code.

APP
1. Download and install vscode 
2. In vscode install the plug-in named flutter
3. Copy paste the flutter code that has been given in the files section and execute it.
4. Download the .apk for mobile use

A video link of both software and hardware has been shared for your understanding of their working along with explanation of why we have chosen the project and those materials for making up the project
